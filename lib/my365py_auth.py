my365py_auth.py

This module provides the class M365BearerToken.
The class M365BearerToken takes care of obtaining and refreshing the access bearer token needed to authenticate with the Microsoft Graph API.

More specifically this module uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) for Python.
In order to use this library some prerequisites are needed:
1) An Azure AD tenant. If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you already have!
2) An 'app registration' in your tenant. This is the identity of your app. You can register an app in the Azure portal.
3) A client secret for your app. This is essentially the password for your app. You can create a client secret in the Azure portal.
4) Aditionally you need:
   * The tenant ID of your Azure AD tenant
   * The application (client) ID of your app registration
5) In order to restrict / allow what the app registration can do, you need to assign API permissions to the app registration.
   For this application the following permissions are needed (a first go - may change in the future):
   * Calendars.ReadWrite: Read and write calendars in all mailboxes
   * Directory.ReadWrite.All: Read and write directory data
   * Files.ReadWrite.All: Read and write files in all site collections
   * Tasks.ReadWrite.All: Read and write all usersâ€™ tasks and tasklists
   * User-Mail.ReadWrite.All: Read and write all secondary mail addresses for users
   * User.ReadWrite.All: Read and write all users' full profiles
   * User.Read: Sign in and read user profile
